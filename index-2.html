      <h2>History and Origins</h2>
      <p>Chess, one of the oldest and most revered board games in the world, traces its roots back to 6th century India where it was known as Chaturanga. From there, it spread to Persia, where it evolved into Shatranj, and eventually made its way to Europe through Islamic expansion. Over centuries, the game underwent numerous rule changes and refinements, becoming the modern game of chess we recognize today.</p>
      <p>By the 15th century, the game had taken a form closely resembling modern chess. The queen and bishop gained their dynamic movements during the Renaissance period, making the game faster and more complex. This evolution reflected the cultural and intellectual movements of the time, transforming chess from a simple pastime into a battle of intellect and foresight.</p>
